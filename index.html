      <h1>Bombai Biryani</h1>
      <p>Mumbaikars have their own version of Biryani and it can be relished 
        at any local non veg restaurant. The best would be to go to some 
        Chilia-muslim run restaurant. A bit oily and with a dash of sweetness, 
        the Bombay Biryani is totally dhamakedar!</p>

      <h1>Kolkata Biryani</h1>
      <p>For those who love their potatoes and meat both, there is Kolkata 
        Biryani. As history goes, the Nawabs of Lucknow were exiled in Kolkata
        after the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny. This was a period when meat wasn’t readily
        available. This led to the cooks to add potatoes to the biryani and
        now that is the trend throughout Kolkata. When you order for biryani 
        in Kolkata don’t be surprised to find equal amount of potatoes and
        meat in your biryani!</p>
