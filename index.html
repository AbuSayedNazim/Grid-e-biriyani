      <h1>Bombai Biryani</h1>
      <p>Mumbaikars have their own version of Biryani and it can be relished 
        at any local non veg restaurant. The best would be to go to some 
        Chilia-muslim run restaurant. A bit oily and with a dash of sweetness, 
        the Bombay Biryani is totally dhamakedar!</p>

      <h1>Bhatkhali biryani</h1>
      <p>Very similar to Bombay Biryani, Bhatkali Biryani is prepared using a 
        lot of onions. It is very popular in the Konkan belt and the adjacent 
        coasts of Karnataka. Since the meat and rice in the Bhatkali biryani

      <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>
      <p>Chicken biryani is a common type which is then converted into other types 
        of biryani through using special types of ingrediants and spices. It is rather 
        a wide component in making different types of famous byriani which changes
      their name and takes a new name. One plate of chicken biryani has 
      protein, carbohydrates as well as fats in one serving. Protein is 
      represented through chicken meat and cashew nuts, carbohydrate comes 
      from the rice, and the fat comes from the oil used. Indeed, vitamins 
      and minerals can also be present if generous amounts of veggies are 
      added inside, or if you decide to make a vegetarian version of biryani.
      Chicken meat contains niacin or also known as vitamin B3. Niacin acts 
      as a detoxification substance, energy supplier, 
      as well as guarding the body from serious health issues</p>
